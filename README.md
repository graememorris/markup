i have to try and find the method of pulling and pushing to this remote - github  
so i'll link this readme to a folder called notes, which will contain one file - called 01.md  
and then i'll clone the repo to my computer, make a branch, modify it, then try to figure out how to make changes and apply them to the main thing...
